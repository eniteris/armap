# armap
Automated map maker from Dwarf Fortress maps

Export all maps and xml and txt files to a folder within /Map Data, then run script, maps will appear in /Maps.

The maps that are required are:
* Elevation
* Biome
* Vegetation
* Hydrosphere
* Structure

Most parameters are in the beginning of the program, including various alternate color schemes.

Code is ultimate spaghetti. Observe at your own risk.
